# Introduction

## Why Applied Statistics

 - [Data are everywhere!](https://www.science.org/toc/science/331/6018)
 
   * Large amount of data that come with **uncertainty** and **variability**
   * We want to learn something about these data, but what?
   <!-- uncertainty: multimodality, measurement errors (in data collection, precision of measurement), sampling uncertainty (we have a sample not an entire population so if this sample is not representative...) -->
   <!-- variability: even if you control for all the features you can think of, you still have variability in your data -->
   
## Why Should I Learn Applied Statistics? 

To understand spatial and temporal (climate change) dependencies

## Job of a Statistician

Understand a complex world by describing it in relatively simple terms that capture essential aspects of its structure, and provide us some idea of how uncertain we are about that knowledge

* think about uncertainty and bias (anticipate and reduce it)
* build models emulating nature
  - inference about the models leads to conclusions about nature -- but what if the model is a poor representation of nature?
* provide *interpretable* models allowing for rational conclusions
  - prediction vs. information extraction
  - all models are wrong $\Rightarrow$ critical model validation
* estimate variation ($\Rightarrow$ confidence intervals, significance)
* draw conclusions from data
* traditional role: statisticians invited to analyze existing data
  - e.g. does the existing data contain the desired information?
* modern role: collaborative step-by-step
  - from acquisition of data to presentation of results
  - interdisciplinary communication
<!-- * exploratory vs. confirmatory analysis -->

## Domains of Application

- actuarial science
- biostatistics (medicine, pharma, genetics, etc.)
- business
- chemometrics
- econometrics
- epidemiology
- finance
- geostatistics
- machine learning and AI
- official statistics (demography, surveys, etc.)
- psychology
- quality control
- reliability
- physics
- signal processing
- ...

## Why Models?

We build models in order to

- (1) understand the nature,
- (2) predict the future, and
- (3) control the world. [or was it rule the world?]

\hfill -- Patrick Winston (former director of the AI lab at MIT)

\bigskip
(1) is the main goal of applied statistics
    - interpretation
    - parsimony
(2) is the main goal of AI
    - average accuracy
(3) is just to slam the message home

> All models are wrong, but some are useful.

# Organization

## Organization

- This course: a taste of real world problems and challenges for future statisticians

- Emphasis on models and inference: we
overview several techniques of statistical modelling, and discuss real life problems

- Project based evaluation:  

   * you will be challenged to use these tools to learn from the data
   
- This course is problem-driven, and hence you are responsible for understanding what are the appropriate models to analyze the data and to implement these computationally
   
   * reproducibility of the analysis, and effective and rigorous communication
of your analyses are assumed acquired from MATH-517

## Project Submission

R/RStudio, Markdown/Quarto (or eventually LaTeX) and GitHub will be needed

  - submissions are made through GitHub Classroom (see dedicated tutorial on the [MATH-517 course website](https://math-517.github.io/math_517_website/resources/tutorials/github_classroom.html))
    

## Evaluation

The grade will reflect on the quality of the projects, which are expected to

* identify questions of interest
    - some will be provided during the description of the project
* choose appropriate models to analyze the data
    - demonstrate understanding of the models used
* implement the models in R
    - though this is probably not displayed in the report
* critically evaluate shortcomings of your models (model diagnostics)
    - a good solution may be to provide more than one model at first and eventually compare those
* use a final model to answer the questions of interest

## Evaluation

It is imperative that the final report is

* readable
    - figures need to have self-explanatory captions, appropriate font size, and be generally of a decent quality
    - there should be no code in the report, unless it significantly improves clarity of the report (e.g. R table instead of a Latex table is permitted for simplicity) and even in such a case it has to be verbally explained around any code chunk what it actually does
* reproducible
    - i.e., the R Markdown file can be run again on a different machine inside a copy of your Github repo
    - code is well commented
    
This makes projects iterative work, where most of the work done (e.g. data exploration and model selection) is underrepresented in the final report

## Report Writing

Some (paraphrased) quotes:

 - If a work is not compiled into a report, it does not exist. If the report is not readable and reproducible, the work is useless.

- Think about what you want to write and then write it as clearly and economically as possible. That is all there is to academic writing.

## Report Writing

- The length of the reports should be between 8 and 15 pages, all included

- The reports should include: 

 * An abstract
 * An introduction presenting the problem
 * A description of the data
 * An exploratory analysis of the data (with some relevant plots)
 * A statistical description of the method(s) used to analyse the data
 * An interpretation of the results (with some relevant plots)
 * A conclusion

## Evaluation

* 7 projects in total (for you to choose from)
    - specific data and tasks to perform
    - done individually, but exchange of ideas (but not the code) is encouraged
* 5 projects will form your chosen portfolio
    - Project 1 is mandatory
    - at least one from Projects 2-3
        - you will get a detailed feedback on this one
    - at least one from Projects 4-5
    - at least one from Projects 6-7
* Project 1 (linked heavily to MATH-517) gets a grade of its own (not provided), the rest will be graded during the final oral examination

\vspace{-2mm}
* this course is "without withdrawal" (submit Project 1 $\equiv$ commit)
