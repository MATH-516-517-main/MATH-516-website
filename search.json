See here for details.\nThe main project can start following the \\(7\\)-th lecture, deadline on December 24, at 23:59. This is a soft deadline. I would suggest you finish the project before Christmas, however, if all members of the team agree to this, the project can be submitted by the end of the calendar year. This is recommended in order to prevent the holiday season ruined by a lazy member(s) of the team. Note that if a single member of your team wishes to submit on December 23, you are required to do so. See here for details.\n Groups can be of size of either 2 or 3 people. The size will not matter w.r.t. to grading. However, a group of size 3 will have one additional task to do: as part of their submission, every team member will individually include a short paragraph describing contributions of every individual member of the team. This is not to be discussed among the team members, as it serves as a safeguard. Regardless of their individual contributions, each member of the team will receive the same grade, apart from where this would be extremely unfair. Such cases will be discussed personally. In case of any team-work problems, the students are encouraged to seek advice (mostly as a group) from the teachers (mostly during the exercise classes)."

We will be providing code examples and suppport in all three languages.\n\n\nWhat software do I need to install?\nYou will need to use git, and a text editor or IDE.\nFor git, please see here for instructions on how to install it.\nYou can use any kind of text editor or IDE you like. We recomment using VS Code with the extension corresponding to your language of choice. You can also use Rstudio for R. See here for instructions on how to install the software and IDEs.\n\n\nHow do I submit an assignment?\nWe will be using Github-classroom to distribute and collect assignments. You will need to create a Github account if you don’t already have one.\n\n\n\nTechnical issues\n\nI am lost with Github, what should I do?\nGitHub has possibly the best tutorials and documentation of any software out there. You can find the Hello world there. Most of the time googling your issue will lead you to the right place.\n\n\nI have bugs in my code/ something doesn’t work/ I don’t know how to do something, what should I do?\nFirst google your issue. 90 times out of 100 this will solve your issues. Another 9% can be resolved by reading the documentation of the software you are using. For the very last percent you can ask your question during the exercises hours.\n\n\nI cannot find the repository linked to the assignment, what should I do?\nAt the top of each assignment there should be a link you can manually click to accept the assignment. If this happens after the first assignment, please let us know."
