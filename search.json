We will gladly help you, within our capabilities, if you are using Python or Julia.\n\n\nWhat software do I need to install?\nYou will need to use git, and a text editor or IDE.\nFor git, please see here for instructions on how to install it.\nYou can use any kind of text editor or IDE you like. We recomment using VS Code with the extension corresponding to your language of choice. You can also use Rstudio for R. See here for instructions on how to install the software and IDEs.\n\n\nHow do I submit a project?\nWe will be using Github-classroom to distribute and collect projects. You will need to create a Github account if you don’t already have one.\n\n\n\nTechnical issues\n\nI am lost with Github, what should I do?\nGitHub has possibly the best tutorials and documentation of any software out there. You can find the Hello world there. Most of the time googling your issue will lead you to the right place.\n\n\nI have bugs in my code/ something doesn’t work/ I don’t know how to do something, what should I do?\nFirst google your issue. 90 times out of 100 this will solve your issues. Another 9% can be resolved by reading the documentation of the software you are using. For the very last percent you can ask your question during the exercises hours.\n\n\nI cannot find the repository linked to the project, what should I do?\nAt the top of each project there should be a link where you can manually click to accept the project. If this happens after the first project, please let us know.",

minor improvements could enhance readability.\nAdequately organized but with some awkward transitions or unclear sections.\nStructure is inconsistent; several sections lack clarity.\nPoorly organized with significant structural or logical gaps.\nLacks structure or coherence; difficult to follow.\n\n\n\nStatistical Rigour and Relevance\n\nComprehensive and rigorous analysis using appropriate and justified methods.\nVery thorough analysis with strong justification of methods used.\nSolid analytical approach with minor lapses in justification or depth.\nAnalysis is adequate but lacks depth or critical evaluation.\nBasic analysis with limited justification or engagement with assumptions.\nWeak analytical approach; inappropriate or poorly explained methods.\nNo meaningful analysis; inappropriate methods or absent justification.\n\n\n\nCorrectness of Statistical Methodology\n\nStatistical methods implemented flawlessly, with precise assumptions and correct interpretation.\nMinor issues present, but implementation and interpretation are nearly flawless.\nCorrect use of statistical methods with occasional small errors or ambiguity.\nAcceptable use of statistical methods but some key issues or misunderstandings.\nMisunderstandings of assumptins of the methods or inconsistent implementation.\nMajor conceptual errors or incorrect application of statistical methods.\nIncorrect or missing application of statistical methodology.\n\n\n\nCommunication of Results\n\nExceptional clarity in presenting and interpreting results, with excellent use of visualisations.\nClear and effective communication of findings, with well-chosen visual aids.\nMostly clear presentation; some visualisations could be improved.\nResults communicated with basic clarity but limited interpretative depth.\nPresentation is difficult to follow or lacks effective visual representation.\nFindings are poorly explained or interpreted.\nResults are not communicated clearly or not at all.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nExceptional critical reflection; provides deep insights into main findings, thoroughly evaluates complex limitations, and proposes innovative generalisations or future work.\nVery thorough summary and reflection; clearly identifies findings and provides a strong, well-justified analysis of limitations and potential extensions.\nSolid discussion of results; effectively summarises main findings and provides a clear, though perhaps less exhaustive, evaluation of limitations and future work.\nAdequately summarises findings but lacks depth in critical evaluation; mentions basic limitations and standard future directions.\nBasic summary of results with limited reflection; identifies few limitations and provides only generic suggestions for future work.\nPoorly explained results with little to no critical reflection; significant gaps in identifying limitations or the broader context of the work.\nFails to provide a meaningful discussion; no analysis of limitations or future directions provided.\n\n\n\nReferencing\n\nFlawless referencing using a scientific and consistent style; bibliography is comprehensive and includes all key literature relevant to the field.\nVery high-quality referencing with only minor, negligible formatting issues; all sources are correctly cited and well-integrated.\nCorrect use of referencing with occasional small errors in formatting or minor omissions in the bibliography.\nBibliography is acceptable and covers primary sources, but may have inconsistent formatting or some missing in-text citations.\nInconsistent or incomplete referencing; several key sources are missing from the bibliography or incorrectly cited in the text.\nMajor errors in referencing; bibliography is poorly structured, and many claims lack necessary citations.\nReferencing is entirely absent or severely inadequate,.\n\n\n\nOriginality\n\nInnovative approach; goes beyond standard methods or expectations with clear creativity.\nDemonstrates original thought; integrates unique ideas or perspectives effectively.\nSome original contributions; occasional creative solutions or extensions.\nShows effort to personalize or extend ideas but remains mostly conventional.\nLimited originality; mostly relies on standard approaches.\nMinimal evidence of original thinking or novel application.\nEntirely derivative; no original contribution.\n\n\n\nQuality of plots and tables\n\nExceptional visual clarity; plots are informative, well-labeled, and enhance understanding.\nHigh-quality plots with clear labels, titles, and relevance to the analysis.\nPlots are accurate and mostly clear; minor improvements needed in formatting or clarity.\nAdequate plots; some unclear labels or formatting issues.\nPlots included but inconsistently formatted or partially unclear.\nPoor quality plots; difficult to interpret or lacking key labels.\nPlots missing, incorrect, or irrelevant.\n\n\n\nWriting Quality\n\nFluent, polished academic writing with no grammatical errors.\nWell-written and mostly error-free; tone and style are appropriate.\nGenerally clear writing with occasional minor errors.\nUnderstandable but with frequent stylistic or grammatical issues.\nWriting lacks clarity and contains multiple errors.\nSignificant issues with grammar, spelling, or tone.\nWriting is unclear, error-ridden, or unprofessional.\n\n\n\nLength and quantity of materials presented\n\nWell-balanced length; extensive yet concise materials that enhance clarity and depth.\nSlightly longer or shorter than ideal, but overall well-justified and effective.\nSufficient quantity; minor imbalance in length or depth.\nMeets basic expectations for quantity but lacks efficiency or depth.\nSome gaps in material or excessive redundancy.\nSignificant under- or overproduction of content; lacks purpose.\nMaterial is missing or overwhelming with no added value.\n\n\n\nImprovements on ChatGPT Code (if applicable)\n\nCode significantly improved with thoughtful optimization and clear enhancements.\nNotable improvements made, with clear rationale and better functionality.\nImprovements evident, though some changes may be superficial.\nSome effort to improve, but limited impact or unclear reasoning.\nMinimal changes; unclear if improvements were made.\nCode copied with minor edits and no clear enhancement.\nChatGPT code used without modification or with detrimental changes.\n\n\n\nReproducibility and Code Quality\n\nFully reproducible with clean, well-documented, modular code.\nReproducible with mostly clean and documented code.\nCode runs with minor issues; mostly readable and somewhat documented.\nCode runs but lacks documentation or clarity in structure.\nReproducibility is limited; poor documentation or disorganized code.\nCode is difficult to interpret or partially functional.\nCode is missing, broken, or not reproducible at all.\n\n\n\nOral examination\n\nDemonstrates an exceptional mastery of all projects; provides a flawless summary of findings and approach.
