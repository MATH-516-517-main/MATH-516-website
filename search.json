    "text": "FAQ\n\nOrganizational\n\nWhich language will we be using?\nYou can use either Python, R, or Julia. We will be providing code examples and suppport only in R, though. We will gladly help you, within our capabilities, if you are using Python or Julia.\n\n\nWhat software do I need to install?\nYou will need to use git, and a text editor or IDE.\nFor git, please see here for instructions on how to install it.\nYou can use any kind of text editor or IDE you like. We recomment using VS Code with the extension corresponding to your language of choice. You can also use Rstudio for R. See here for instructions on how to install the software and IDEs.\n\n\nHow do I submit a project?\nWe will be using Github-classroom to distribute and collect projects. You will need to create a Github account if you don’t already have one.\n\n\n\nTechnical issues\n\nI am lost with Github, what should I do?\nGitHub has possibly the best tutorials and documentation of any software out there. You can find the Hello world there. Most of the time googling your issue will lead you to the right place.\n\n\nI have bugs in my code/ something doesn’t work/ I don’t know how to do something, what should I do?\nFirst google your issue. 90 times out of 100 this will solve your issues. Another 9% can be resolved by reading the documentation of the software you are using. For the very last percent you can ask your question during the exercises hours.\n\n\nI cannot find the repository linked to the project, what should I do?\nAt the top of each project there should be a link where you can manually click to accept the project. If this happens after the first project, please let us know.",
