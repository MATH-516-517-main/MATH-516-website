This is the homepage for MATH-516 Applied Statistics in Spring 2024 at EPFL. All course materials will be posted on this site.

You can find the course syllabus [here](/course-syllabus.qmd) and the course schedule [here](/). All the additional ressources can be found either on [this page](https://math-517.github.io/math_517_website/resources/resources.qmd) or by using the search bar on the top left corner of the website. These ressources include project descriptions, datasets, tips and tricks, etc...

# Course Content



Apart from the topics mentioned [in the schedule](index.qmd), mastering this course requires scripting (simulation studies and data exploration & visualization tasks), as well as sharing your code via **GitHub**. You will be required to do a small project a final project, and various assignments fostering these skills. **Exercise classes should be attended** and used to pick up the required skills, and work on these projects and assignments! Additional exercises can be found in the Exercices tab on this website.

# Evaluation

The assessment method for this course is "controle continue", meaning that the course and all the work required from the students effectively with the end of the semester. 

There will be 7 projects (data analyses) in total:

1.  EM Algorithm - Daniela’s Data
    - Weeks 1 and 2 (19.2.-3.3.2024)
2.  GLMs - Climate-related Disasters
    - Weeks 3 and 4 (4.3.-17.3.2014)
3.  Logistic Regression - TBD
    - Weeks 5 and 6 (18.3.-31.3.2024)
4.  Linear Mixed Models - Energy Expenditure in the Human Body
    - Weeks 7 and 8 (8.4.-.21.4.2024)
5.  Causal Inference - Tubingen datasets
    - Weeks 9 and 10 (22.4.-5.5.2024)
6.  Extreme Value Theory - The Vargas Tragedy or Rainfall data in Switzerland
    - Weeks 11 and 12 (6.5.-19.5.2024)
7.  Statistical Consulting
    - Week 13 (15.5.-26.5.2024)

Of these 7 projects, every student needs to choose 5 of them. At least
one project needs to be chosen from each of the following subsets:

    - Projects 1,2,3,
    - Projects 4,5,
    - Projects 6,7.

The projects will be worked out and handed in by each student
individually, but collaborations in small groups is encouraged as long
as other students’ work and ideas are attributed properly in each
idividual project.

**Grading** 
<!-- will be done on a rough scale. For example the assignments will be mostly graded on a binary basis, you either receive full 5 % or nothing. Similarly the projects will be graded in 5 % increments. Notice that 5 % corresponds to 0.25 increment on the 1-6 scale used at EPFL. As a result, skipping an assignment will irrevocably reduce your final grade. On the other hand, the assignments will be short and simple, and serious attempts to solve them should resolve in the full mark. Similarly for the projects, with one exception: 10 % of the final project will be awarded for value added (original data analysis, simulation study answering a previously unclear question, etc.). -->

**Deadlines** will always be set at the end of the week (23:59 on Sunday). A project from Week $k$ (given on Monday) will always have its deadline on Week $k+1$ (i.e. the midnight between Sunday and Monday following the $(k+1)$-th week, see [the schedule](index.qmd)).


# Materials

All materials will be gradually made available on this website. Lectures and Projects can be accessed through their respective tabs. Supplemental materials can be found in the [`Ressources`](resources/resources.qmd) tab. Lecture slides will be posted in the [schedule](index.qmd).


# Handing-in Assignments and Projects

We will use GitHub Classroom to handle the projects for this course. See [this page](resources/tutorials/github_classroom.qmd) for more information on how to use GitHub Classroom.
