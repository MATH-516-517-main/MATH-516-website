This is the homepage for MATH-516 Applied Statistics in Spring 2026 at EPFL. All course materials will be posted on this site.

You can find the course syllabus [here](/course-syllabus.qmd) and the course schedule [here](/). All the additional ressources can be found either on [this page](https://math-516-517-main.github.io/math_517_website/resources/resources.html) or by using the search bar on the top left corner of the website. These ressources include project descriptions, datasets, tips and tricks, etc...

# Course Content

Apart from the topics mentioned [in the schedule](index.qmd), mastering this course requires scripting (simulation studies and data exploration & visualisation tasks), as well as sharing your code via **GitHub**. Check out [this manual](https://math-516-517-main.github.io/math_517_website/resources/tutorials/github.html) from the previous course (MATH-517, a **mandatory prerequisite**). **Exercise classes should be attended** and used to pick up the required skills, and work on the projects!

# Evaluation

The assessment method for this course is "controle continue", meaning that the course and all the work required from the students effectively end with the end of the semester. 

**Project 1 is mandatory** (deadline is Monday, March 2) and the course is "without withdrawal", i.e., whoever submits Project 1 is committing to the course and will eventually get a grade.

There will be 7 projects (data analyses) in total:

1.  Fundamental frequency of vowels
    - Weeks 1 and 2 (16.2.-1.3.2026)
2.  GLMs - TBD
    - Weeks 3 and 4 (2.3.-15.3.2026)
3.  Causal Discovery - TBD
    - Weeks 5 and 6 (16.3.-29.3.2026)
4.  Linear Mixed Models - TBD
    - Weeks 7 and 8 (30.3.-19.4.2026)
5.  Extreme Value Theory - TBD
    - Weeks 9 and 10 (20.4.-3.5.2026)
6.  Statistical Consulting - TBD
    - Weeks 11 and 12 (4.5.-17.5.2026)
7.  Oral Examination
    - Week 13 and 14 (18.5.-29.5.2026)

Of these 6 projects, every student needs to work on 4 of them. Three projects are mandatory and one can be chosen from a subset of projects: 

    - Project 1 is mandatory,
    - Project 3 is mandatory,
    - Project 5 is mandatory,
    - Projects 2,4,6: choose one of them.

The projects will be worked out and handed in by each student
individually, but collaborations in small groups is encouraged as long
as other students’ work and ideas are attributed properly in each
idividual project.

**Deadlines** will always be set on the first day of the week (23:59 on Monday). A project from Week $k$ (given on Monday) will always have its deadline on Week $k+2$ (i.e., the midnight between Monday and Tuesday on the $(k+2)$-th week, see [the schedule](index.qmd)).

**Grading** will be based on pre-defined criteria. See [the grading criteria](grading-criteria.qmd) for details.
<!-- will be done on a rough scale. For example the assignments will be mostly graded on a binary basis, you either receive full 5 % or nothing. Similarly the projects will be graded in 5 % increments. Notice that 5 % corresponds to 0.25 increment on the 1-6 scale used at EPFL. As a result, skipping an assignment will irrevocably reduce your final grade. On the other hand, the assignments will be short and simple, and serious attempts to solve them should resolve in the full mark. Similarly for the projects, with one exception: 10 % of the final project will be awarded for value added (original data analysis, simulation study answering a previously unclear question, etc.). -->


# Materials

All materials will be gradually made available on this website. Lectures and Projects can be accessed through their respective tabs. Lecture slides as well as projects' descriptions will be posted in the [schedule](index.qmd) or the dedicated Moodle webppage.


# Handing-in Projects

We will use GitHub Classroom to handle the projects for this course. See [this page](https://math-516-517-main.github.io/math_517_website/resources/tutorials/github_classroom.html) for more information on how to use GitHub Classroom.
