If the report is not readable and reproducible, the work is useless.\n\n- Think about what you want to write and then write it as clearly and economically as possible. That is all there is to academic writing.\n\n## Report Writing\n\n- The length of the reports should be between 8 and 15 pages, all included\n\n- The reports should include: \n\n  * An abstract\n  * An introduction presenting the problem\n  * A description of the data\n  * An exploratory analysis of the data (with some relevant plots)\n  * A statistical description of the method(s) used to analyse the data\n  * An interpretation of the results (with some relevant plots)\n  * A conclusion\n\n## Evaluation\n\n* 7 projects in total (for you to choose from)\n    - specific data and tasks to perform\n    - done individually, but exchange of ideas (but not the code) is encouraged\n* 5 projects will form your chosen portfolio\n    - Project 1 is mandatory\n    - at least one from Projects 2-3\n        - you will get a detailed feedback on this one\n    - at least one from Projects 4-5\n    - at least one from Projects 6-7\n* Project 1 (linked heavily to MATH-517) gets a grade of its own (not provided), the rest will be graded during the final oral examination\n\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n* This course is \"without withdrawal\" (submit Project 1 $\\equiv$ commit)\n\n## References (for the 1st half of this course)\n\n\\footnotesize\n* Wood (2017) Generalized Additive Models: an Introduction with R (2nd ed.)\n    - even though mainly about GAMs, this book has a short and practical exposition to linear models and GLMs that has a value of its own\n    - computational flavor\n* Davison (2003) Statistical Models\n    - nice reference due to the content breadth; is self-contained , but no `R` code\n* Gelman & Hill (2006) Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models\n    - focuses very much on interpretation\n    - eloquent/lengthy and not always to the point (or precise)\n* Wickham & Grolemund (2017) [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)\n    - useful guide to `tidyverse`, i.e., data exploration and manipulation\n\n## A Quick Poll\n\nWhat are your expectations from this course? \n\n  - want/need to get out of it\n  - [Click here to answer](https://app.wooclap.com/BQZIXK?from=instruction-slide)\n  \n\n![](/images/Wooclap_survey.png){width=50%}\n",
