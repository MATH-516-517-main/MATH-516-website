## Tips and tricks for visualisation

1. Consistency is the most important thing for a statistician.
   - jumping between different citation styles is bad
   - having some captions centered above the figure produced by R and others flushed right below using Markdown is annoying
2. Save space for better readability.
   - plots that convey little information don't have to be large, several (related) plots can be put next to each other on the same line, etc.
   - even in an `html` file, unnecessary scrolling back and forth when reading a report is annoying
   - a plot frame with one or two boxplots is a waste of space (e.g. histograms would be better)
   - barplots can often be replaced by tables to both save space and improve readability
   - in general, if a plot only shows like 3 numbers and is not important for any argument made, it should not be a plot
3. Story-telling matters.
   - it is important to grasp attention with an introduction (and describe at the same time what to expect from a report)
   - re-iterate the most important ideas/results in several places
   - comment on plots even if they are self-explanatory
4. More on plots.
   - text in figures (labels, etc.) should be of similar size as the main text
   - labels have to be readable, e.g. no overlaying etc.
   - captions are necessary and should make the plot self-contained (without looking at the paragraphs around it)
5. Less is sometimes more.
   - showing a scatterplot only to colors to it based on a group of two on the next plot, then adding one regression line, and then two regression lines on the fourth plot... just dilutes the important parts
   - Barplots colored by an additional variable should probably be replaced by a table (potentially colored by the cell
  values -- coloring for better readability only).
6. List of references should be itemized or enumerated (in order to be readable).
7. Avoid using local paths.
   - reproducibility of the report itself!
8. Transforming variables.
   - if your plots look bad because of a clear skewing in one of the variables, transform the varible (typically plot it on a log-scale)
   - if plotting on a log-scale, consider `log10` or `log2` to have better interpretability
